notes: "According to the Census \"group quarters are places where people live or stay, in a group living arrangement, which is owned or managed by an entity or organization providing housing and/or services for the residents. This is not a typical household-type living arrangement. These services  may  include custodial or medical care as well as other types of assistance, and residency is commonly restricted to those receiving these services. People living in group quarters are usually not related to each other.\" Examples of group quarters are correctional institutions, juvenile facilities, skilled nursing facilities, college residence halls, military barracks, group homes, and workers’ dormitories.  "
