    <p>Here you can browse through a curated list of data that helps illuminate what the City is doing around housing as well as give context on housing and population from other sources like the Census.</p>
    <p>The browser is broken up into two main areas: Housing Overview and Policies and Programs. Each chart or map gives a window into a specific topic to hopefully help you understand what does housing look like now and how is the City addressing affordability via policies and programs.</p>
    <h2>Housing Overview</h2>

    <h2>Policies & Programs</h2>
    <p>Data here is specific to particular policies or program areas. You can click through these datasets to get a lens on how different policies and programs are operating. If you need more context on the policy or program itself, you can click on <b>Read more about this policy</b></p>
